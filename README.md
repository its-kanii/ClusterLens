# ClusterLens
ClusterLens is an interactive data visualization tool that demonstrates the working of the K-Means clustering algorithm through a dynamic video-based visualizer. Built using Streamlit for the user interface and OpenCV for real-time frame generation, this project is designed to help users intuitively understand how clustering works in 2D space.
